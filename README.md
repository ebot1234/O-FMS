O!FMS is designed to be used with and without the field hardware. If you choose the version for withouot the full field electronics, there is not scoring cappiblities, you will have to use your own scoring software. 
The O!FMS Dev team will release a version around every Augest for the main Offseason time. 

For hardware we use Automations FMS Hardware and Year-Specific Hardware which is built for year to year. 
The field Access Point can either be the Linksys 1900ACS and the Linksys WRT610N. They don't use VLANing yet. Just DCHP addressing, which is why we recommend that you only use robots on that router. 
VLANs hopefully will be included in this years release.

Happy Offseasoning

-O!FMS Dev Team
