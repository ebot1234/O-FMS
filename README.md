O!FMS is designed to be used with the field hardware provided by Automation Direct.
The O!FMS Dev team will release a version around every Augest for the main Offseason time. 

For hardware we use Automations FMS Hardware and Year-Specific Hardware which is built for year to year. 
The field Access Point can either be the Linksys 1900ACS and the Linksys WRT610N. They don't use VLANing yet. Just DCHP addressing, which is why we recommend that you only use robots on that router. All hardware will come pre-flashed with O!FMS and all its other software that it needs to run your event properly. O!FMS does NOT have a way to make team schedules, you will need to have your own scheduling software at your event, this hardware and software is for scoring and managing the robots on the field.

Happy Offseasoning
